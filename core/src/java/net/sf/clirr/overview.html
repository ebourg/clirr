The Clirr implementation.

<p>
<strong>
WARNING: Clirr is currently in alpha state and the API is not stable.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
If you'd like to write an IDE plugin, you can use the Clirr API provided here,
but be aware that the API might change in the next release of Clirr.
</p>

<p>
You should not refer to the packages labeled 'internal' in your code, though
(we follow the same
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/article.php?file=Article-API-Use/index.html">guidelines</a>
as Eclipse).
