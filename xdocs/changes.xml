    <release version="0.3" date="in CVS">
        <action dev="lkuehne" due-to="Stephen Colebourne" type="fix">
            Fixed a copy + paste error in field modifier comparison logic
            that would lead to false alarms and undetected compatibility
            problems.

            <!-- RFE #958810 -->
            Detect changes of field types.

        <action dev="lkuehne" type="add">
            <!-- RFE #958808 -->
            Ant Task fails when filesets origFiles or newFiles are empty.
            Empty file sets are usually a setup problem - they should not
            create the impression that there are no compatibility problems,
            just because Clirr didn't report anything.
        </action>
        <action dev="lkuehne" type="fix">
            <!-- RFE #958807 -->
            Documented formatter subelements in Ant task.
        </action>
        <action dev="lkuehne" type="add">
            <!-- RFE #958808 -->
            Warn about compile time constant value changes. Changing the value
            of a constant is not binary incompatible (you won't get any Exception),
            but client code compiled against the old version of the library will
            have the old value inlined and continue to use that old value.
            See the Java Language Spec, Chapter 13.4.8, for details.
        </action>
        <action dev="lkuehne" type="add">
            <!-- RFE #958809 -->
            Warn about adding new superclasses to a class derived from java.lang.Throwable.
            Such changes are not binary incompatible (you won't get any Exception),
            but a different catch clause might get selected in client code.
