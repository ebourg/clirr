            <p>
                The latest release of Clirr is available from the <a
                href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=89627">Sourceforge
                download page</a>.

        <section name="Compile Clirr yourself">
            <p>
                To compile Clirr yourself you need to have the
                following tools installed on your machine and
                available in the command line search path:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> 1.0.2.
                    Maven 1.1 might also work but is currently untested.
                    Maven2 will not work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A CVS client. If you are on Linux you probably
                    already have that. If you are on Windows, you can use
                    the binary that is included in the WinCVS
                    distribution. For other platforms, please search
                    Google for a precompiled client or build one
                    yourself using the sources available from the <a
                    href="http://www.cvshome.org">CVS homepage</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To build Clirr, open a command line shell, cd to an empty
                directory and enter the following commands (when prompted
                for a password for anonymous, simply press the Enter key):
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that the anonymous CVS server on Sourceforge is
                under heavy load, and you might experience
                difficulties when checking out the sources. This is
                temporary, please try again a few minutes
                later. Sourceforge is currently in the process of
                installing more capable hardware.
