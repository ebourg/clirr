                     <a href="http://jdiff.sf.net">JDiff</a> is a javadoc plugin
                     that reports api contract changes, based on the Javadoc of
                     the code. This approach is complementary to that of
                     Clirr - JDiff seems to be a great tool for manual
                     inspection during release preparation, while Clirr is well
                     suited to detect one class of compatibility problems
                     automatically during the nightly build.

                     The <a href="http://www.intellij.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/APIComparatorPlugin">APIComparatorPlugin</a>
                     for the <a href="http://www.intellij.com">IntelliJ IDEA</a> IDE
                     is an interactive tool that presents binary api diffs visually.

                     If you like Clirr because you want to deliver quality work
                     to your users, you might want to have a look at
                     <a href="http://checkstyle.sf.net">Checkstyle</a>, a tool
                     for automatic code inspection.
                     The development teams of Clirr and Checkstyle overlap,
                     so if you like Clirr, you will probably love Checkstyle.
